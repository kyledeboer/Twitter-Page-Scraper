# Twitter-Page-Scraper

This program uses the Tweepy API to scrape 1000 tweets from a specific twitter page. 
The program prompts the user to enter their twitter developer account credentials, the name of the twitter page to scrape (include the '@' symbol),
as well as a list of "positive" and "negative" words.
Note: When inputting positive and negative words, separate each word with one space, words are NOT case sensitive
The program searches through the tweets and calculates the frequency with which the positive and negative words appear in the tweets.
The program then inserts relevent information regarding the tweets into an excel file.
